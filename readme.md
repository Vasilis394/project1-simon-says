The game: Simon says

The plan:
* The game contains buttons and a bracket to fill a required word
* Simon will order you to either press one of the buttons, or to write a word
* The game contains 10 attempts
* The game will have a certain timer to do or not to do a command
* The more attempts you do, the more difficult the game will get (time given will be decreased)
* You win if you succeed at all 10 attempts
* If you run out of time or do a wrong command at even one attempt, you lose!
* You press the button (or fill an input) ONLY when it says 'Simon says'
* ANYTHING else other than 'Simon says' must not be obeyed

Additional details:
* The game needs an introduction and a 'start' button to begin the game (which removes the intro screen)
* Whether you win or lose, the button 'Play again?' should be displayed, which returns you to attempt 1
